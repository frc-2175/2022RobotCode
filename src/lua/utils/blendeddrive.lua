--Curvature drive is a drive mode that doesn't let you turn in place, like driving a car,
--but is better at driving curves at high speeds.
--Arcade drive is a drive that can turn in place, but the turning becomes wonky at higher speeds
--Blended drive sorta mashes the two together to have a more smooth way of turning and driving,
--both at high, low, and stopped speeds.
--(to speak technically it linearly interpolates between the two speed curves to have it 
--blend in a more intuitive(?) way.)

	local curvatureLeft, curvatureRight = DifferentialDrive:curvatureDriveIK(moveValue, turnValue, false)

	lerpT = clamp(lerpT, 0, 1)
